A place for technical writing. Essays live on my [Substack](https://sketchingtowards.substack.com/), for the time being.

You're welcome to email me at `sam dot kritch at gmail`.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Math works, after some effort:

$$|\vec{a}|^2 |\vec{b}|^2 = {|\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}|}^2 + {|\vec{a} \times \vec{b}|}^2$$

Comment sections are mirrored from Bluesky, following [this post](https://natalie.sh/posts/bluesky-comments/) as inspiration and plagiarizing most of the code from [their](https://github.com/espeon/blog/tree/main) repo.
